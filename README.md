A Travel Journal created with React. The process involves breaking down the webpage structure into components using JSX and then importing them into the App.js file. The final step included importing the App.js file into the index.js file followed by using ReactDOM to render the final React application. The map function is used in conjunction with props to dynamically render the array of data from the data.js file based on the data passed as a prop.
